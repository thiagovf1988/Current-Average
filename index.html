      Boris Johnson has left the hospital After one week UK's Prime Minister
      Boris Johnson has left the hospital. The Prime Minister has expressed how
      grateful he is for all the NHS's staff care in special for two foreign
      nurses. The Prime Minister addressed how the synergy between the people
      that work directly and indirectly for the NHS in the battle against the
      coronavirus saved his life and is being a vital force for the country. The
      Prime Minister will continue his recovery treatment at Chequers.
