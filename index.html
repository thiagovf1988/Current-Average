    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>Boris Johnson has left the hospital
        After one week UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson has left the hospital.
        The Prime Minister has expressed how grateful he is for all the NHS's staff care in special for two foreign
        nurses.
        The Prime Minister addressed how the synergy between the people that work directly and indirectly for the NHS in
        the battle against the coronavirus saved his life and is being a vital force for the country.
        The Prime Minister will continue his recovery treatment at Chequers.</p>
